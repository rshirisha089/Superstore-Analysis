# Superstore-Analysis
Analysisng a superstore data and creating a interactive dashboard using Tableau

I created an interactive Analytics Report for Superstore USA using Tableau in the initial days of upskilling myself and this project really helped me strengthen my hands-on skills in data visualization and business analytics.
🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

- Technology emerged as the highest-revenue category, contributing 36% of total sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.
- At the sub-category level, Phones, Chairs, and Storage drive the most sales, showcasing where customer demand is strongest.
- California, Washington, and Oregon stand out as top-performing states, while central and midwestern regions show potential for growth.
- By segment, Consumer leads with over 50% of sales, indicating strong B2C performance.
- Profit margin remains healthy at 12%, with a manageable 5.9% return rate.

The sales trend shows steady growth from 2014 to 2018, highlighting consistent business expansion.

Working on this dashboard helped me deepen my understanding of:
